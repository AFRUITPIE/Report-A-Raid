# Report-A-Raid
An application for those not at risk of ICE raids to help those who are at risk - WINFO Hackathon 2018 

## Requirements
A current installation of Xcode with the current version of Cocoapods.

## Installation
A Google credential from Firebase is needed. These credentials can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com).

After adding these credentials to the root directory, one can install the necessary dependencies with:
`$ pod install`
`$ open reportaraid.xcworkspace`

## React Companion App for Demo
Available [here](haydenhong.com/raid), this simple button React app allows one to easily trigger a raid in the demo iOS application.

It is available in the repository under `trigger-raid` and is set up like any other React application with `$ npm install`.
